# Intelligent-Shopping-Cart-using-RFID
The purpose of this project is to provide a handsfree and hassle-free shopping experience to the user in the supermarket who suffers from the problems such as having chaotic time moving the baskets, overcrowding at one place for a certain product on sale, theft, spending a very long time standing in the queue in the counter for bill payment, etc.
